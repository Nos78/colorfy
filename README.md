# Colorfy
## Also known as Colourfy
> Because we know how to spell the word *correctly*

***colour*** / ***color*** (*noun*): the quality of an object or substance with respect to light reflected by the object, usually determined visually by measurement of hue, saturation and brightness of reflected light; saturation or chroma; hue.

-***fy*** (*suffix forming verbs*):, to make or become.

**colorfy** is a python library to provide colour to an otherwise boring, plain old dull black & white [*ANSI compliant*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) terminal.

## Example
```python
    print (colorfy.WARNING + "This is a warning!")
```
```diff
- This is a warning!
```
